# C64_Scrolling_PAL
VSP is used to scroll the screen from left to right.

NOTICE that I was planning to add bidrectional horizonthal scrolling, but for lack of time it ended up being from left to right only.
NOTICE that this repo does not contain any Line Crunching code: I was planning to add it at a later time but got busy (it may still arrive in the future though.)
